Do you care about privacy, democracy, consumer rights, 
small businesses or a more healthy & dynamic economy? 
Do you prefer innovation to be built from the ground up rather than our 
(technological) future written for us by a few powerful corporations?

## I develop a Browser

Suggestions:

* block all third-party cookies/tagging/storage by default
* zero-tolerance for fingerprinting: 
    * offer users different levels of protection in your settings
    * the most advanced should have generic languages preferences, 
  alignment to closest popular screen dimensions, generic client signature
  (browser type, version and operating system), generic fonts list, ...
* don't hide your privacy settings into deep or convoluted menus
* option to disable auto-play of videos and sound
* permanent graphic indicators and toggles for capturing devices (camera, mic, location)
    * make it easier to temporary enable on demand

## I run my own web site

Suggestions:

* test for non-Chrome browser: Firefox, Safari, ...
* test with high privacy settings enabled
* consider using alternative services to Google Analytics, Google captcha (e.g. [hcaptcha](//.hcaptcha.com/)), ... 
* don't fingerprint users
* support other authentication methods than Google or Facebook

A reader should be able to answer basic question about their data in less than one minute.
E.g. which data do you collect? Where do you store it and for how long? Which companies do
you share it with, for which reasons? How can I review my data? How can I ask for my data 
to be removed?

## Non-profit organisations

Please be transparent about your funding sources. Name all the organisations,  
and describe the nature and amount of their support. At least provide a range 
and include material, human, intellectual or virtual resources they offer you.

Be aware that receiving support from organisations that are involved in the domain you are
working on should naturally question about your independence and should therefore be declared 
publicly if you are concerned about your credibility. This also applies to intermediaries 
(e.g. non-profit organisation which are funded by key agents in that industry). This is
even more crucial with research or academic environment where independence is often assumed.
