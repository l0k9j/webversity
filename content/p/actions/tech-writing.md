title=Recommendations for tech writers

Whether you are a journalist or blogger, if you write about technology in 
the press or on the web, you can have a positive contribution by following
some simple recommendations:

## Increase coverage of alternative organisations & projects

For the past twenty years a handful of tech companies have received more 
than 80% of press coverage in most mainstream media outlets. The causes of that 
disproportionate bias are multiple and will be analysed in the 'Issues' section
of this site.

We believe this is a manifestation of the Matthew effect: it reinforces the
competitive advantage of large companies by giving them free publicity.

Just like good radio show presenters who will continuously hunt for talents 
among emerging, independent and lesser known bands and give the a platform 
and broadcast time, we believe good tech writers have a duty to move the
spotlight on innovative or high quality projects from star-ups and other
types of organisations. This is good for local economy, competition, and for
consumers. It is a proactive way to help society make more informed choices
and take part the construction of its technological future. Passive writing 
is simply waiting for a big tech to acquire a company and make their product
global.

Good journalism is more than PR, re-tweet or change log; it reveals the 
important facets of an industry that the general public doesn't have the 
resources to witness. 

## Mention alternative solutions

Big Tech solutions are often the best because they are the most feature-rich,
mature, affordable, usable and sustainable. This is mainly because they have 
exceptional amount of resources at their disposal to support their products, 
even during the early phase of development.

There are however many solutions by other vendors which are perhaps less 
advanced but score much higher in other areas. Some of those areas, such as
privacy, transparency, independence, or new monetisation models have become
increasingly important for consumer in the past decade following many
sensational revelations about the excesses & abuses of Big Tech.  

We think that review articles and mainstream recommendations about tech 
services could better serve consumers and society by questioning the
traditional evaluation criteria and offering a wider range of suggestions,
free of pre-conceived prioritisation (e.g. popular services are almost 
always mentioned first). 

See our 'assessment criteria' page for ideas about other ways to compare
products/services and inform readers.

## Integrate ethical issues in your reviews

Despite the growing debate around the highly questionable data capture 
practices of Big Tech, it is still very common to see reviews for privacy 
sensitive products (e.g. virtual assistants, smart home devices, surveillance
system, operating systems) which completely elude the ethical dimensions. This 
dissociation between detailed technical and usability review and 
the broader human and social implications can be quite striking. Again there
might be multiple and complex causes behind that practice and it would be 
useful to investigate them.

The comparison might be exaggerated but it does look a bit like reviewing 
cigarette brands or financial products without providing any disclaimer about
the usage risks. Writers aren't obligated to remind the readers beyond 
existing regulations. But ethics is much more subtle than the law. If there
is any doubt about the full nature of the service or product it would greatly
help readers (who are not all tech savvy or well versed in marketing & data
management strategies) to at least systematically raise the topic. This
could take the form of a single sentence linking to articles about data 
privacy or news about abuse of privacy by tech companies or other reviews
of that product that expand on the ethical aspects.
