title=Simple tips to improve your digital privacy

[This is a work in progress, we'll improve this guide over time]

## Windows

* Go to your "Privacy Settings" and review everything one by one. 
This can take up 5 minutes but its worth it. We recommend you untick everything
unless its really needed
* Go to "Apps and Features" and uninstall all the apps you don't use
* If you don't use Cortana, go to "Cortana & Search Settings" then untick everything

## Browser

* Uninstall all non-essential extensions (extensions can spy on you)
* Install a reliable add blocker extension (e.g. uBlock Origin) and disable it
only for the site you trust and support (e.g. your favourite news site)
* Chrome has a very bad reputation for privacy. Use it **only** for Google 
services: e.g. Gmail, Google Drive, Google Doc.
* Use another **privacy-first** browser for everything else (including web searches).
[Brave](brave.com) is almost identical to Chrome but more committed to your privacy. 
[Firefox](firefox.com) is also an excellent option as it is champions an open and diverse Internet;
* Switch to other search engine than Google Search or Bing. e.g. DuckDuckGo,
StartPage, Qwant;
* Review your browser settings. Be very conservative. 
Especially the "Privacy and Security section" and the cookie options.
Enable "do no track", disable "third party cookies".

## Passwords

* **never** use the same password for more than one account
* use short **unique** phrases rather than single word
* never share a password with anyone else. If you did, change it now
