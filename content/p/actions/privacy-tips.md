[This is a work in progress, we'll improve this guide over time]

## Windows

* Go to your "**Privacy Settings**", review all the options one by one, untick 
anything that is not absolutely needed. This can take up 5 minutes but it's worth it.
* Go to "**Apps** and Features" and uninstall all non-essential apps
* If you don't use **Cortana**, go to "Cortana & Search Settings" then untick everything

## Browser

* Uninstall all non-essential **extensions** 
[[why](//www.howtogeek.com/188346/why-browser-extensions-can-be-dangerous-and-how-to-protect-yourself/)]
* Install a reliable **ad-blocker** extension (such as [uBlock Origin](https://getublock.com/)) 
and disable it only on the sites you trust and support (e.g. your favourite news site)
* Chrome has a very bad reputation for privacy. Use it **only** to access Google 
services such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Doc.
* Use another **privacy-first browser** for everything else (including web searches).
[Firefox](//firefox.com) is an excellent choice, 
[Brave](//brave.com) is very good if prefer a Chrome look-alike;
* Review your **browser settings**. 
Especially the "Privacy and Security". Also enable "do no track" 
and disable "third party cookies", and autocomplete searches.
* Google **Search**, Bing, Yahoo or Yandex track your searches. 
Instead use privacy-first engines like Qwant or Duckduckgo;

## Passwords

* **never** use the same password for more than one account;
* use short **unique** phrases rather than a single word;
* **never share** a password with anyone else. If you did, change it now!
* for more sensitive services (e.g. main email account) it's better to
use a **2-factor** authentication app (e.g. Aegis or Authy) rather than to give 
away your phone number or other other personal details;
* **never** answer security questions in the same way (e.g. name of your first
pet, your first car, etc.);

## Email

* Gmail reads your email for marketing purpose, so do many other providers
to make money with your private information for advertising purpose;
* **New generation** of email services such a Tutanota, Posteo, ProtonMail 
are designed especially to keep your communication secure & private;
* It can be laborious to switch provider but you can do it gradually, 
starting with new contacts or the most sensitive ones;
* Never respond to blackmail from strangers. If they insist, report them;
* Send **personal or sensitive information** only to people you know and trust, 
if possible zip and encrypt personal documents (e.g. photo, etc.) and ask them 
to delete after use;

## Messaging

* Just like emails and browsers, the mainstream messaging clients such as
Whatsapp are often the worse. Even if they claim their system is secure, 
most for-profit organisations collect and exploit your data;
* Use privacy-first alternatives such as Signal or Telegram;
* Any message you send can potentially be recorded, leaked or used against you, 
so if you have anything sensitive to say/send it might be best to think twice
before sending. Discrete face-to-face conversations are more forgiving;

## Mobile

* limit the number of native apps. Remove all junk or rarely used apps from your
phone. Many services (e.g. news) have very good web equivalent;
* also review all your iOS or Android settings from time to time;
* don't give away you mobile number to companies unless it's absolutely necessary. 
It's a pain to change number, once its leaked to careless parties it can fall 
into any hand and be used to identify you or pester you;
