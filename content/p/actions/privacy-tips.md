title=Simple tips to improve your digital privacy

[This is a work in progress, we'll improve this guide over time]

## Windows

* Go to your "**Privacy Settings**", review all the options one by one, untick 
anything that is not absolutely needed. This can take up 5 minutes but it's worth it.
* Go to "**Apps** and Features" and uninstall all non-essential apps
* If you don't use **Cortana**, go to "Cortana & Search Settings" then untick everything

## Browser

* Uninstall all non-essential **extensions** 
[[why](//www.howtogeek.com/188346/why-browser-extensions-can-be-dangerous-and-how-to-protect-yourself/)]
* Install a reliable **ad-blocker** extension (such as [uBlock Origin](https://getublock.com/)) 
and disable it only on the sites you trust and support (e.g. your favourite news site)
* Chrome has a very bad reputation for privacy. Use it **only** to access Google 
services such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Doc.
* Use another **privacy-first browser** for everything else (including web searches).
[Firefox](//firefox.com) is an excellent choice, 
[Brave](//brave.com) is very good if prefer a Chrome look-alike;
* Google **Search**, Bing, Yahoo or Yandex track your searches. 
Instead use privacy-first engines like Qwant, Duckduckgo or StartPage;
* Review your **browser settings**. 
Especially the "Privacy and Security". Also enable "do no track" 
and disable "third party cookies".

## Passwords

* **never** use the same password for more than one account;
* use short **unique** phrases rather than a single word;
* **never share** a password with anyone else. If you did, change it now!
* for more sensitive services (e.g. main email account) it's better to
use a **2-factor** authentication app (e.g. Aegis or Authy) rather than to give 
away your phone number or other other personal details;

## Email

* Gmail reads your email for marketing purpose, so do many other providers
to make money with your private information for advertising purpose;
* **New generation** of email services such a Tutanota, Posteo, ProtonMail 
are designed especially to keep your communication secure & private;
* It can be laborious to switch provider but you can do it gradually, 
starting with new contacts or the most sensitive ones.
