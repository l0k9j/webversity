The list below contains links to various projects or interest groups mainly concerned with
the social impact of technologies. This selection has a particular focus on the
groups that claim to work for the defense of human rights or towards positive
social progress.

We provide a short summary of their mission statement, in most case it has been
adapted from statements we found on their site.

We are not affiliated to any of them and we do not necessarily support their
objectives or views. We encourage the visitors to check their sources of
funding & the position of their leaders to better understand their motivations
and influences.
