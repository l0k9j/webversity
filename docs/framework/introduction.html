        Introduction
      </h1>

      <div class="content">
        <h2 class="title is-2">Digital revolution</h2>
<p>A global trend since the invention of modern computing and the internet is the 
rapidly increasing reliance of humanity on digital platforms. Emails, word processors,
news sites, satnav, search engines, online marketplaces, music and film streaming, 
smartphones have taken over letters, pen and papers or typewriters, newspapers, 
paper maps, business directories, tapes, DVDs, cinema and fixed phones respectively. The result 
is an ever greater share of human activities, whether professional, social, administrative,
educational or entertainment, being mediated through hardware and software. We spend
more time than ever in a two dimensional world projected on a screen, interacting
with digital services.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2">Scaling and Concentration</h2>
<p>One key characteristic of digital services, compared to the traditional ones, is 
that they can scale globally. Thirty years ago you would go to a local music shop to browse
cd/dvd players produced by a variety of manufacturers, buy your own onw and bring it home,
now the trend is to subscribe to the same music streaming service used by millions of
other people. You can chose your next mobile phone from a good variety of brands, but 
in almost all cases the Operating System is either from Google or Apple. Basically the 
virtualisation of products combined with the ubiquiteness of the web tend to create new 
markets dominated by very few companies.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2">Hyper-mediation</h2>
<p>Another distinctive characteristic is that the content these services mediate is no longer
confined to one place, it can come from anywhere and go everywhere in an instant. That 
continuous movement of our data allows for a plethora of third party actors to step in, snoop in,
augment, transform and record. If in the past you would privately browse your favourite
newspaper at home, nowadays the owners of the news site know which article you read, when, 
from where, whether you read it until the end and then pass that information to contractors, 
advertisers, etc.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2">Power shift</h2>
<p>The conclusion is that we are moving towards a hyper-mediated services owned by a few powerful
actors sharing your behaviour and the content you read or write with entities often unknown
to you. What makes this situation even worse is that the most successful companies in one
market often gain a disproportionate economic advantage in related markets. Which leads to
mega-companies taking control over a dangerously broad range of services. So broad their products
and governance have major impacts on society and that, in turn, allows them to
influence the democratic system that is supposed to scrutinise and regulate them.</p>
