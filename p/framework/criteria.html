      <div class="content">
        <h2 class="title is-2">Criteria</h2>
<p>These criteria promote privacy, innovation, variety in a fair and competitive market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>privacy</strong>: the service &amp; producer must have a strong commitment to highest 
standards of privacy (i.e. no tracking, minimal data capture, encryption, minimal sharing)</li>
<li><strong>interoperable</strong>: easy to move your data/settings to another service</li>
<li><strong>open source</strong>: the entire code of the software should be public</li>
<li><strong>permissions</strong>: the service should request as little permissions as 
possible on your device </li>
<li><strong>independent</strong>: from influence, material benefit or connections to large
organisations, especially from Big Tech</li>
<li><strong>affordable</strong>: preferably free, preferably with no ads or teasers</li>
<li><strong>location</strong>: company &amp; service preferably located near you or in a democratic
region; avoid geographic concentration </li>
<li><strong>sustainable</strong>: a service that will last many years</li>
<li><strong>quality</strong>: service must offer all essential features &amp; good usability</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title is-2">Explanations</h2>
<h3 class="title is-3">Open Source</h3>
<p>If the code of the app is open source it can be scrutinised by any developer 
for data collection, hidden features, programmed obsolescence, security holes.</p>
<p>Open Source software can't lie about their intentions and flaws. Moreover,
if the software has a large enough community of developers, those flaws can
be corrected.</p>
<p>The second major advantage of Open Source is that it allows the industry to
build many variants of a software. Google Chrome is a variant of the open
source Chromium which itself is the basis for a myriad of other privacy-aware
browsers. The same applies to Linux: MacOS, Ubuntu, Android, Windows Subsystem 
for Linux all inherit from the same code base.</p>
<p>While Open Source is not a necessary condition, it naturally improves other
criteria such as "affordable", "sustainable", "privacy", "interoperable" 
and "quality".</p>
<p>Note that some products, like Google Chrome, are based on open source code
but do also contain proprietary and closed-source code.</p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Quality</h3>
<p>It is quite common for "alternative" apps not to reach the same level of
quality as big tech offerings. Lack of features or sub-standard user interface
is often the price to pay for a more ethical or innovative product. By keeping
the pain of a lack of privacy, choice or innovation sufficiently hidden from 
the users, Big Tech can win the competitive battle mainly due to fact that
most people naturally want the best features at the lower cost with a great user 
experience.</p>
<p>We recommend that apps should offer at least essential features normally 
expected by the user and no usability issue that makes the use of core
functions a constant frustration. Unfortunately every new product will
be lacking on those area at the beginning.  </p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Permissions</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered why a calendar application on your smartphone need
permission to access your location or your camera? An app can claim that the 
location permission is to give you weather forecast. In reality a massive amount 
of personal and professional information can be inferred from polling your
location data several times a day. Companies can know where you work,
where you live, where you bring your children to school, where you eat
at lunchtime, where your friends and family live, how you commute, when &amp; 
where you go on holiday and how often, etc.</p>
<p>An Android phone doesn't even need GPS or Wifi turned on to tell in which
area you are currently standing.</p>
<p>We recommend that apps should ask only for the minimum amount of 
device permission to support their core functions.</p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Interoperable</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons Whatsapp's users find it difficult to move to 
alternative messaging services, even if they offer the same functions with
better privacy, is that they won't be able to communicate with their 
friends &amp; family and they can't transfer their past messages to the 
new application. They end up with yet another messaging app and a fragmented
communication environment.</p>
<p>Interoperability means that two apps can share data seamlessly. For instance
you can transfer your bookmarks from one browser to another. You can open
a PDF document from many different places.</p>
<p>Lack of interoperability is normal in a nascent industry where vendors
experiment with vastly different solutions and data structures. Eventually
unifying data standards are designed to address that problem. The opposite
trend, the anti-interoperability strategy, has been used for decades by 
dominant companies to lock their user's content in and keep their customers.</p>
<p>Interoperability is beneficial for new-comers (and thus for competition) and
users but a threat to dominant vendors.</p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Sustainable</h3>
<p>Moving an account from one service to another is a hassle. When we open 
an email account, a cloud storage account, a messaging app, we hope we 
can keep them for as long as possible. Big Tech with their great surplus
of resources and their too-big-to-fail critical mass are able to offer
that very long term guarantee of service that a start-up could never dream of.</p>
<p>Even the largest companies have an surprising record for abandoning ambitious 
and large projects: https://killedbygoogle.com/.</p>
<p>Choosing an alternative is a risk. Particularly if it is not interoperable.</p>
<p>Things to look for in an alternative solution: adoption of industry standards,
years of experience, size of its community, use of open source code, strategic
commitment to long term development.</p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Privacy</h3>
<p>A lot has been said about this in recent years. This is a vast and complex
topic. It is also a difficult criteria to assess because it is less visible
than other conditions. Movement of personal data and the information that
can be inferred from are difficult to track. We can look at the type of 
permissions a software requires, we can look at its code (in some cases)
but once the data reaches remote servers it can propagate easily and 
accidentally (or intentionally) without much barrier.</p>
<p>New regulations can only go so far. GDPR was designed to give control to
the users about their data but in practice an employer can justify passing
the data to a chain of contractors under the various exemptions allowed by 
the law. Regulators can't see the complex operations companies apply to their 
data. Backups are cheap. Data transfer don't leave traces. Data is easily leaked. 
Even anonymised data can be cross-referenced with other sources or special 
patterns analysed to match them with user profiles.</p>
<p>If all data operations left permanent traces, checking compliance
with regulations would be feasible. This is why privacy is mainly 
based on trust. And despite all that, despite the severe violations
of trust done by companies like Facebook, their user base keeps growing.</p>
<p>To assess privacy of an app, we have to look at its terms &amp; conditions,
the companies it involves, their history, their business model, where they
are based, ...</p>
<p>Although this is still a leap of faith, it might be time to give a chance
to the companies that have, at the core of their business model, given
top priority to the highest standards of data privacy. Those that claim 
zero-knowledge, (real!) end-to-end encryption, that ask for the absolute 
minimum of information. Those that treat personal data as a toxic asset.</p>
